        <h1>Open Hearts Club<h2>
        <h2>Hi friends! I'm so glad you're on this journey with me!</h1>
        <h3>A path of healing to the point of having hearts that can open and close</h2>
        <p class="thoughts">I'd had the vague concept of OHC for years, but it wasn't until I healed (enough of)
            my own childhood trauma that I really hatched my plan.

             I used to intentionally manifest us!
            </p>
        <p class="thoughts">Each one of you I've chosen and invited, or someone I trusted vouched for you.
            This is an invite-only club, for those who want more connection and tribe
             and are doing the work to get it! I'm so proud of all of us; this is such hard work and you're doing it.
             Sending you loves!
             </p>
